# CoffeeShare

Welcome to **CoffeeShare** – a simple and secure peer-to-peer file sharing platform built with **Next.js**. Share files with ease and efficiency, just like sharing a cup of coffee. No cloud storage, no middleman – just fast, direct file transfers between peers.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer File Sharing**: Share files directly between users without needing a central server.
- **No Sign-Up Required**: Upload and share files instantly – no account or login needed.
- **Fast Transfers**: Thanks to P2P technology, files are transferred quickly and efficiently.
- **Secure Encryption**: Your files are encrypted during the transfer to ensure privacy.
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamlessly works across both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Temporary Links**: File links expire after a set period or once downloaded, ensuring privacy.

<!-- ## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed (version 14.x or later).
- **npm** or **yarn** (package managers).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffeeshare.git
   cd coffeeshare
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # OR if you're using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # OR with yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see CoffeeShare in action. -->

<!-- ### How It Works

1. **Upload Your File**: Drag and drop a file or use the file selector to upload.
2. **Generate a Shareable Link**: Once the file is uploaded, a unique URL will be generated.
3. **Share the Link**: Send this link to anyone you want to share the file with.
4. **Download**: The recipient clicks the link and can download the file directly. -->

<!-- ### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building the app.
- **React**: For the component-based UI.
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer communication and file transfer.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication between peers.
- **CryptoJS**: For file encryption during transfer.
- **Vercel**: For easy deployment (optional).

## Security

- **File Encryption**: Files are encrypted before transmission to prevent unauthorized access.
- **No Persistent Storage**: We don’t store your files on any server. The files exist only between peers.
- **Short-lived Links**: File links expire after a set period or after the file is downloaded to ensure privacy.

## Deployment

You can deploy your own instance of **CoffeeShare** using **Vercel** or any other hosting service that supports Next.js.

1. Push your code to your GitHub repository.
2. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (or another platform).
3. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy it.

Once deployed, you can share your unique CoffeeShare link with others!

## Limitations

- **File Size**: While there’s no strict file size limit, transfers may take longer for very large files.
- **Network Stability**: P2P transfers depend on stable internet connections on both ends.
- **Browser Support**: The app works best in modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Future Improvements

- **Multiple File Sharing**: Allow users to upload and share multiple files in one session.
- **Download Resumption**: Add support for resuming downloads if interrupted.
- **Mobile App**: Build native apps for iOS and Android to extend functionality.
- **File Preview**: Allow users to preview files (images, PDFs, etc.) before downloading. -->
